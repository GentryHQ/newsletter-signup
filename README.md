## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS
- JS




### What I learned
- It has been a while since I wrote code because I've been busy in Nursing School, so I used this project to remind myself of the syntax, and getting back into shape. It turned out fun and very interesting, although I had problem remembering so stuffs which made it even more fun, because I'd to look it up and learnt more in the process.

- I actually had problem with get the email input value but with the help from a friend and some we surfing, we knocked it out!



### Continued development

I think in te future, I might actually add this form with a blog website I did sometime ago.
